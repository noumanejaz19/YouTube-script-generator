Bikers Mess with the WRONG Veteran at Gas Station

The Roar of motorcycles filled the air as a group of bikers pulled into the dusty gas station on the outskirts of town. The Sun Beat Down mercilessly, making the heat Shimmer off the cracked asphalt. It was meant to be a peaceful dawn on the outskirts of Pine Valley, until a group of rough-looking bikers decided to harass the wrong man - a decorated Marine veteran who was about to teach them a lesson they'd never forget.
